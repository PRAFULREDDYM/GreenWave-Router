# GreenWave-Router
GreenWave Router is a signal-aware routing engine that predicts red-light delays using cycle-phase timing data. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Supabase, it features a custom delay model, geocode caching via Nominatim, and a Python ETL pipeline for geospatial data. It optimizes urban travel by annotating stop predictions.
